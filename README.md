BD2 LAB DEMO
=====================

Little demo created with academic goals.
It's developed with Flask, MySQL and Docker.

New changes will be uploaded week by week.

By now, first you must launch db going into db/ directory and typing ```docker-compose up -d```.
Then, you must init app writing `python3 index.py` after going into app/ directory.
